# The Digital History Project: A Podcast, "Jo Before Van Gogh."
## Devlog 3
### Work I've Done Since Last Time
In a week, I've made a bit more progress on the podcast, mostly in terms of the overall look of the project. I've decided to host it all on a Wordpress site for the time being because I'm familiar with it but I'd also like to learn a bit more about how to use it. In addition to the episodes, I'd like to include a page with some information and pictures (if available) of some of the recurring characters in Jo's life. I'm a very visual learner, so I thought these pictures and information would help to crystallize the individuals for my listeners. I've started compiling some of the pictures of her relatives and friends, in addition to making notes for their short biographies.Also on the site, I’d like to include a page that has different images of maps that are pertinent to Jo’s life that have points mapped out on them that the listener can click on. When they do, something will pop up that will tell them either who lived in the house that point is noting or what special landmark resides there that was important to Jo, or if there’s a school there that Jo taught at, etc., etc. Along with the photos/bios, I think this could really help people, especially those who’ve never had the pleasure of going to the Netherlands before, to visualize the locations that Jo is hopping around to. I reached out to the help/advice page on Discord for what to use for this aspect of the site, and Sarah C suggested I use genial.ly, which I had never encountered before, but is perfect for my purposes! I look forward to learning how to use this new bit of digital tech.
I also began listening to a podcast called, "Aack Cast," by Jamie Loftus, to get some inspiration surrounding what a podcast created and hosted by a woman could be. There are plenty of other podcasts I could have used as examples, but what I especially liked about Aack Cast was how Loftus treated the excerpts from the Cathy comics that she included. Instead of just describing the comics and reading them herself, she introduces her ‘cast’ for the comic readings in the first episode and has them do performative readings of the characters in the scenes. This was a very effective theatrical technique, because as a listener, it gave me a much better understanding of the comics and how funny they really were. I think I’d like to employ a similar tactic in Jo Before van Gogh. Instead of having the main diary entries bookend the episodes, I’m going to have one of my actor friends read the excerpts from the diary that I will weave into the episode. I think this will help give Jo a definitive voice and bring her to life in a new way that I hadn’t considered before. 
I also started mapping out the contents of each of the podcasts. At this point, I think it will be about six episodes long, but I'm not sure of the length of each of the podcasts. I think the first episode will be an overall introduction to Jo's story, an overview of her family and their life, a pertinent history of Amsterdam/the Netherlands and then a summary of her life from 1862 (her birth)- 1880 (just before she began her first diary). There isn't too much information regarding Jo's early years, which is why it's being tacked on with all this other stuff. Episode 2 will cover 1880-1881, including her high school years, introducing the recurring themses in Jo's diary, introducing her high school friends, her first love, etc. Episode 3 will cover 1882-1884, and will begin with her first expedition abroad to study in London and right before she leaves for her first teaching job in Elburg. Episode 4 will cover 1884- 1885 which is her time teaching in Elburg. Episode 5 will be 'the Eduard years' when she was falling in (and reluctantly out of) love with Eduard Stumpff, 1886- October 1888. Episode 6 will be the final one, and will cover the end of 1888 and her engagement to Theo van Gogh at long last. 
I’ve written the introduction to the first podcast, which I’ve included in this repo. 
 
### Where to Go from Here
This week, my goal will be to finish writing the first episode of the podcast, reach out to some actor friends to find a voice for Jo’s diary excerpts, and then create the site for the podcast. That means finishing to compile the pictures/bios, the interactive maps, and then write a more thorough breakdown of the six episodes for everyone’s perusal. In my final week (Dec 5-10), I’m going to record and edit the first episode and have it all ready to put a nice fat bow on it by December 10. Whew!

### Challenges
Thankfully, I didn’t encounter too many technical difficulties this week. However, I am my own worst enemy. I keep psyching myself out, thinking that someone with just a few years of historical research experience like me shouldn’t be trying to make a podcast like this. But I think if I just keep plodding along as I have been and if I’m happy with my outcome, I’ll feel much more confident in my abilities.  I’ll be interested to see how using genial.ly goes as well! That’s all for this week, I think.
