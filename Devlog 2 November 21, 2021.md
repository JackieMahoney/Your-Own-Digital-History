# The Digital History Project: A Podcast, "Jo Before Van Gogh."
## Devlog 2
### Work I've Done Since Last Time
The past two weeks have been a lot more translating and researching. One thing I discovered with the translating is that a lot of my problems arose when the last word on the page would be split between that page and the next one. When taking a picture of the page to use the google translate scanner, it would translate the half of the last word into gibberish and mess around with the context of the sentence as well. To combat this, what I started doing was deleting the last line from the translation when I took a picture of the page, and then I would type out the last sentence in Dutch, translate it, and paste it in. Took a lot longer but made the book flow a lot better. I also realized Google was trying to translate the page numbers into words (???), so keeping track and deleting those also made the book flow more smoothly. I finally managed to translate the section of All for Vincent that I needed for this project. What I thought would be 95 pages turned into 117, so it took a bit longer. What made it take even longer is that the google sheet that I had been using on my phone to make it easy to copy and paste the translation wouldn't let me add any more because my google drive was full. What fun. So I had to add another step in there and copy the translation into an email to myself, send it, then copy and paste it from the email into a word document on my computer. It sounds like a minor inconvenience but it blocked up the works significantly. Funny how the little things always end up being the biggest problems, eh? Anyways, once the book was finally translated, I took to actually reading the book and taking notes. It went a little faster because a lot of the author's notes about Jo are obvious in her digitally transcribed diaries (which I also finished reading and taking notes for this week), so I didn't need to note quite as many things. While I was reading Jo's diary I compiled a document of all of the quotes that I thought would be significant for my reasearch and purposes. It was a little like when you're highlighting to study for an exam and you end up just highlighting the whole page because EVERYTHING is important- Jo had so many good insights and things to say that it was difficult to toss any details away. Once I was done all my reading, I began working on the recording of the first diary for the first episode of the podcast. It went seamlessly, and the practice that I had doing my Carpathia letter during Digital Tune-Up really helped out. I used Audacity, as always, and even got the latest version of it and was DELIGHTED by the upgrades that had been made to it- check it out if you haven’t yet! The only problem I encountered with this was I couldn’t get my cat to stop begging for food long enough to have a quiet apartment to record in! I’ve attached the recording for you to listen to.
While considering the background SFX to add in, I did a bit of research into what sorts of sounds would have been heard in Jo’s world in 1880. At that time, she was living at her parent’s home at 121 Weteringschans in Amsterdam. According to the book, that area of Amsterdam was still fairly rural at the time, which is why I chose to only have a horse and carriage running past in the background every now and again. I found this great digitally rendered development of Amsterdam from 1800-1900, which really helped me to situate myself in Amsterdam's history: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5mirkkexSE&t=1s . Jo’s six siblings (Carolina, Hermina, Hendrik, Andries, Elizabeth and Willem) were all also living at home at the time. I found their home on google maps, and if the house is now the same that it was back then (quite likely considering the historic canal homes of Amsterdam), then it is a four story, mid-sized family home. I used a few different layouts of Amsterdam canal houses (https://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/teaching/case/olita/building/construction_building.html and https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-15/the-history-of-amsterdam-s-canal-houses ) to figure out that Jo’s bedroom likely would have been on the 3rd or 4th floor. As well, she likely would have been sharing her room with all her sisters. This contributed to the ‘busyness’ of the background to the diary, as I envisioned her sisters reading, writing, or walking in and out of the bedroom as they completed their nightly chores while Jo wrote in the evening. As well, the reason why the piano continues to play throughout is that Jo’s sisters Hermina and Elizabeth were both piano players, so I imagined one of them would have been practicing downstairs in the parlour. All of the Bongers were musical, so it seemed only natural to have music present in their home. As well, according to the book the Bongers always seemed to have visitors and guests, which is why there’s so much chatter in the background as well. 
# Where to Go from Here
These next two weeks will be all about episode planning and writing, recording and editing the first episode. I still haven’t made a decision about what platform to host this on, but I have been doing some exploring. I might end up going with a wordpress just for now because it is free, has podcast templates, and I can make separate pages where I can post the pictures to go along with the podcast. I can’t do that with Anchor.fm, which was my original idea, but when I eventually create the whole podcast, I’ll post it anywhere and everywhere! I’m feeling very proud of the work I’ve done so far and am very excited to see it all come together… hopefully!
# Challenges
My biggest challenge that I’ve gradually realized over the last two weeks is that this is the first historical thing I’ve created where the facts are the main focus. In the other historical performances, monologues, pantomimes, plays and games that I’ve made, the historic information is essential, of course, but the audience is usually focused on the character and story more. This time, though, I don’t have a character to ‘hide behind’ and have to deliver the facts about Jo’s life as correctly as I can. It poses an interesting challenge, and the amount of respect that I have for the creators of my favourite history podcasts has just gone up by about three thousand percent. There is SO MUCH RESEARCH that goes into a thirty to forty-five minute podcast!
