# The Digital History Project- A Podcast, "Jo Before Van Gogh."
## Devlog 1
### The Idea
For my thesis performance at the end of next year, I'm working to create an interactive performance that incorporates digital aspects about the life of Johanna Van Gogh Bonger, Vincent Van Gogh's sister-in-law. She was married to Vincent's brother, Theo, and when the two brothers died within six months of each other, Jo was left with a one year old son and an apartment full of Van Gogh's work. She's the reason why we have Van Gogh's work today and made him one of the most beloved painters ever. However, until about 2-3 years ago, no one had ever really heard of her.  My thesis focuses heavily on Jo's life in service of her two Vincents- her son and the painter himself, after the death of her husband and Vincent,in order to introduce the audience to the remarkable work that Jo did. However, I also wanted the opportunity to introduce the world to Jo without her relationship to the Van Goghs. That way, she isn't just 'the woman who made Van Gogh,' she also gets to be a person in her own right! With this in mind, I wanted to create a podcast that focused on Jo's life before she was introduced to Theo and Vincent, which for Jo meant up to age 26.  

### The Work I've Done So Far
These last two weeks have been all about research and translating. There is only one biography of Jo, published in 2019 by the Van Gogh Museum called "Alles Voor Vincent" or "All For Vincent" by Hans Luijten.  Because it was published so recently, it hasn't yet been translated from Dutch to English, which means that I've had to do that work using google translate. I take a picture of the page, google translates it, I put it all into one document, I read it, I take notes. Repeat ad infinitum! Its a 486 page book, but thankfully only the first 97 deal with Jo's life pre-Van Gogh (but I'll have to translate the whole thing eventually though). In addition, I read and took notes on Jo's first two digitized diaries that can be checked out here: https://www.bongerdiaries.org/dagboek_jo_1 The first diary spans from March 26, 1880- December 10, 1881. Jo was 17-19 years old here. The second diary spans from 4 July 1883- 9 August 1885 when Jo was 21-23. 

### Where to go From Here
Once I've finished reading the third diary and translating & reading the other 2/3 of the first section of the book, my plan is to create an eposodic breakdown of the podcast. For example, I'm thinking that the first episode will cover Jo's life from birth to age 17, and then the rest of the episodes will centre around the rest of the time from the diaries (1880- 1891). The information presented will be a combination of the what I've gotten from the diaries, the book and what other few online sources I could find. As well, each podcast will begin and end with a recording of the diary entries that will bookend the time span that the podcast is covering. I hope to record these much like I did my 'Letter Aboard the Carpathia' with a combination of the script and the historical soundscape behind it to make the listener feel immersed in Jo's world. I would also perhaps like to create a site that has accompanying pictures for each episode of the podcast. This would be especially helpful for presenting the available pictures of the family members, paintings of Van Gogh's as they are mentioned in the diaries or the book, and any other photographic content. I would also like to provide a transcript of the podcast with the pictures integrated into it for people with hearing loss to be able to experience it as well. 

### Challenges
The large majority of my challenges over the last two weeks have been the translations. Google translate is good, but there are always words that stand out to me as 'is that really what the author meant?' But because I don't have any other methods of double checking the translation, I have to fill in the parts that either don't quite make sense or don't sound quite right with my best guess of what makes the most sense given the context. I would love to eventually discuss the book with a native Dutch speaker to see what little details I missed!
